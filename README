Guard-Stats

Guard::Stats - Guard object generator with utilisation meters.

BASIC USAGE

Suppose we have a long-running application making heavy use of closures,
and need to monitor the lifetimes of those. So...

    # in initial section
    use Guard::Stats;
    my $stat = Guard::Stats->new;

    # when running
    my $guard = $stat->guard;
    my $callback = sub {
        $guard->end("taken route 1");
        # now do useful stuff
    };
    # ... do whatever I need and call $callback eventually

    # in diagnostic procedures started via external event
    my $data = $stat->get_stat;
    warn "$data->{running} instances still running";

METER TABLE

Statistics show numbers of guards for which end()/DESTROY() were called
in various combinations.

	fin=*	fin=0	fin=1
DEST=*	total+	?	finished+
DEST=0	alive	running	zombie
DEST=1	dead	broken+	complete+

A "+" marks values directly measured by Guard::Stats. They all are monotonous.
All others are derived from these.

TIME AND LEVELS

The on_level( [-] $n, CODEFER ) method allows to perform certain actions
upon guard count changes. (-$n means "count decreased to $n").

With a helper class provided, also life times of guards can be measured.

See perldoc for more.
